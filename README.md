# JavaScript Password Generator

For this project, I have created a [password generator](https://mattglwilliams.github.io/password-generator/) using JavaScript. Below, you can see a series of screenshots showcasing the functionality of the website.

When a user lands on the website, below is what is displayed. There is a page title and a box that includes a title, another box where the generated password will go and a button to start the generation process.

When a user clicks the generate password button, they are served a prompt asking them to select the length they want the password to be between 8 - 128.

If a user selects a number outside of the range, they are given an alert telling them to select a number between 8 - 128. When they click OK, they are given the length prompt again.

Once they have selected a valid number, they are asked if they want to include special characters.

Then numbers.

Then uppercase letters.

Then lowercase letters.

If the user doesnâ€™t select any criteria, they are given an alert telling them they must choose at least one and to start again.

Once they have selected their length and criteria, the password is generated.
